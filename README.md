hey so I'm following the rust book and one of the challanges is to build a temperature converter

I did some extra stuff, but I feel I'm lacking the function understanding as I did all in main

but still to me it's a victory, I hope I can keep learning and getting better!

wait, that's none related to the Readme.




Uh.

Well.

If you're already into Rust, just do a cargo build to set it up and the program will guide you
quite simple really, it'll ask for a temperature and if you want to convert from celsius to fahrenheit or the inverse, then some stuff may happen. I try to make stuff humorously at some point so it's surely not that serious too.
